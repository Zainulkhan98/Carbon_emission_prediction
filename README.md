# CO2 Emissions Prediction

This project aims to predict the CO2 emissions of a country based on past data. It leverages the power of machine learning to analyze the vast dataset of "Global Data on Sustainable Energy." This dataset provides detailed information on energy consumption patterns for 176 countries over two decades (2000-2020).

## Features

The project has the following features:

- **Data Analysis**: The project performs an extensive analysis of the dataset to understand the correlation between different features and their impact on CO2 emissions.

- **Predictive Models**: The project develops machine learning models to predict two crucial aspects:
  - Future Energy Needs: Our models aim to forecast the energy requirements of each country in the coming years. This helps us understand the evolving demand for energy sources.
  - Carbon Emission Levels: By predicting carbon emission levels, we can assess the environmental impact of energy consumption and identify areas for improvement.

- **Data Visualization**: The project provides visualizations to understand the correlation between different features and their impact on CO2 emissions. It also visualizes the accuracy improvement of the model over time.

- **User Interface**: The project provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the features of a country and predict its CO2 emissions.
